# ![gSender logo](https://github.com/Sienci-Labs/sender/blob/master/src/app/images/icon-git.png?raw=true)gSender: connect to and control [grbl](https://github.com/grbl/grbl)-based CNCs

gSender is a feature-packed CNC interface software designed to be clean and easy to learn while retaining a depth of capabilities for advanced users. Its development was begun in 2019 out of a passion for hobby CNC machines: **an interface reimagined to suit the needs of the at-home CNC user**.

![gSender](https://github.com/Sienci-Labs/gsender/blob/ae96c701b03d037c30105ecbd5ecc0af6a9edc6f/examples/gsender-newu.jpg)

* **Totally free**
* **Accepts standard, grbl-compliant g-code** from all the common CAM programs
* **Designed to be generic** so any standard [grbl](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/releases) or [grblHAL](https://github.com/grblHAL/core) CNC will work
* **Expands its UI to the needs of your CNC** by recognizing what features it's capable of
* **Works on as wide a range in computing systems as possible** (low-end PC to RasPi, leveraging [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/))
* Used to be based on the popular [CNCjs controller interface](https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs) but has since been mostly re-written

**Our core principals during development have been to:**
1. Make any CNC feel easy to use no matter your previous experience
2. Substitute CNC jargon with simple language when possible
3. Keep the interface flexible to accommodate any common CNC machine
4. Maintain 'power tools' and customizability for advanced users
5. Prioritize interface reliability over new features
6. Otherwise continue pushing forward in any way possible to advance the CNC experience

### Notes for MacOS users

If you get the following error when running the gSender:

```
‚ÄúgSender‚Äù is damaged and can‚Äôt be opened. You should move it to the Trash.
```

To fix this, you need to clear the extended attributes using the following command since gSender is not yet notarized with an Apple Developer ID, macOS may prevent it from running after installation or an upgrade.

```bash
xattr -c /Applications/gSender.app
```
