# Framework rules

Follow these when integrating PostHog into this framework.

- A missing PostHog configuration must never break the app — read keys optionally (never a required setting), guard init and capture behind their presence, and keep build and boot working with no PostHog environment set — but never silently: in development or debug builds fail loudly, using the language's idiomatic error, with the message "<VAR> variable required by PostHog is missing or un-configured, this causes events to be silently missed. This error stops appearing once <VAR> is configured" (substituting the actual variable name); production stays a no-op
- For feature flags, use useFeatureFlagEnabled() or useFeatureFlagPayload() hooks - they handle loading states and external sync automatically
- Add analytics capture in event handlers where user actions occur, NOT in useEffect reacting to state changes
- Do NOT use useEffect for data transformation - calculate derived values during render instead
- Do NOT use useEffect to respond to user events - put that logic in the event handler itself
- Do NOT use useEffect to chain state updates - calculate all related updates together in the event handler
- Do NOT use useEffect to notify parent components - call the parent callback alongside setState in the event handler
- To reset component state when a prop changes, pass the prop as the component's key instead of using useEffect
- useEffect is ONLY for synchronizing with external systems (non-React widgets, browser APIs, network subscriptions)
- Remember that source code is available in the node_modules directory
- Check package.json for type checking or build scripts to validate changes
- When identity comes from framework-bridged state (Inertia or SSR shared props, a serialized session), confirm the backend actually shares that field — add the share server-side if missing — before identifying from it
