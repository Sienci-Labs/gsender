      "New probe type, 3D Probe added, with future plans to support more than standard XYZ probing",
      "All probing cycles now sped up with reduced delays and reduced default retracts to 2mm",
      "Each probe block now has an individually customizable Z thickness",
      "AutoZero touch plate can now have it's thickness set",
      "All AutoZero probing now moves out of the way at the end to make removing the plate easier",
      "Longstanding excess probing movements now removed for speed, safety, and accuracy",
      "AutoZero bit diameter probing now offsetting correctly like in 1.4.11",

      "Spindle delay Config option for grbl machines now applies to Tool Change wizards and Start from line",
      "New behaviour where gSender will ignore M2 or M30 workspace reversion on job completion unless new Config option is toggled on. This should remove the need for using Automations to preserve workspaces.",
