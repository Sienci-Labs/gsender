      "Start job shortcut fixed to work on controllers for grblHAL devices",
      "Updating values does not remove custom jog values on carve page",
      "Added way to change default units on remote view",
      "Bad file/invalid gcode checker will now run if the visualizer disabled in lightweight mode",

      "New probe type, 3D Probe added, with future plans to support more than standard XYZ probing",
      "All probing cycles now sped up with reduced delays and reduced default retracts to 2mm",
      "Each probe block now has an individually customizable Z thickness",
      "AutoZero touch plate can now have it's thickness set",
      "All AutoZero probing now moves out of the way at the end to make removing the plate easier",
      "Longstanding excess probing movements now removed for speed, safety, and accuracy",
      "AutoZero bit diameter probing now offsetting correctly like in 1.4.11",
      "Tooltips re-added across the app for more hover information",
      "Spindle delay Config option for grbl machines now applies to Tool Change wizards and Start from line",
      "New behaviour where gSender will ignore M2 or M30 workspace reversion on job completion unless new Config option is toggled on. This should remove the need for using Automations to preserve workspaces.",

      "Fixed safe height movements sometimes using the wrong units",
      "Fixed shortcuts that weren't acting as expected or weren't triggering",

      "Fixed Config handling of Rotary forcing hard and soft limits for grbl machines",
      "UI styling tweaks, and adjustments to better accommodate smaller screens"
